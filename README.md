An individual assessment, the Final Year Project (FYP) which being assigned at the last semester of Degree. The assessment required us to choose a problem statement and implement a system to improve it based on the current given environment. An abundance of documentation such as research papers and surveys needed to be done in order to record down every single element of the system to justify the purpose of the FYP prior the implementation of the system, and it is a complex task that required careful tendering. In this FYP I have chose to do a website that is focused on improvising the restaurant reservation system with table management feature, such as having the system to be able to automatically optimized the seating of the restaurant accordingly to maximizing the potential revenue of the restaurant within the hourly calculation. System implementation was being done by using the newfound knowledge such as ReactJS, Node, Axious, along with the PHP knowledge in handling the functionalities and finally, the MaterialUI as the core design implementation on the said system.
